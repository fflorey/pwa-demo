# pwa-demo
A simple demo for a progressive web app

Note: This demo uses some cloud services from firebase, and you will need to create your own database backend if you want to run the demo.

What it contains:
1) A very simple pwa, handcoded, to demonstrate and play around with a an app which should be "installable" on your smartphone and which should run without internet connection. If internet conection is available, it shows the temperature of a sensor. The data is stored in the cloud (firebase).
2) A set of simple firebase "functions", which returns the stored temperature values (and can store new ones)

What is not included (so far): The sourcecode for the sensors... may follow later on
